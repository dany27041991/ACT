    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of the Report\n",
    "\n",
    "1. System Efficiency:\n",
    "    * A larger value of the $$\\frac{A_{sc}^1}{A_{si}^1}$$ ratio indicates that the buoy is more efficient at using available energy than an incomplete discharge.\n",
    "    * A lower value may indicate inefficiencies or losses in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Resource Management:\n",
    "    * The ratio helps determine how well resources are being used compared to an ideal situation.\n",
    "    * It can be used to optimize resource management, balancing between complete and incomplete discharges as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $A_{sc}^1$ is a matrix or factor representing the amount of energy completely discharged by the first buoy.\n",
    "* $A_{si}^1$ represents the amount of energy incompletely discharged.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A_{sc}^1$=100 energy units and $A_{si}^1$=50 energy units, the ratio would be $\\frac{100}{50}$=2. This ratio can be used to evaluate the buoy's performance relative to ideal energy use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\frac{A_{sc}^1}{A_{si}^1}$ ratio indicates the relative efficiency of complete discharge versus incomplete discharge for the 1st buoy. This concept is crucial to optimize resource management in the buoy network, allowing real behavior to be compared with ideal behavior and improving operational strategies."
